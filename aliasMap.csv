# This file allows you to force search name aliases for any rom filename.
# One filename + alias per line. DO NOT ADD THE LAST SUFFIX such as ".zip"!
#
# Note 1:
# This file is global and will be used when scraping ANY platform.
#
# Note 2:
# All bracket info in the search name alias is ignored.
# It merely provides a different base name for Skyscraper when it creates
# the search query. It is meant to help scrape files that have abstract file-
# names where the search-based scraping modules have a hard time finding good
# results, or you know the specific entry in direct-match scraping modules.
# If you wish to keep or add brackets to a title you can still do so by adding
# them to the actual filename instead.
#
# Format (without the quotes):
# "Rom Filename (Europe);Use This Name Instead"
