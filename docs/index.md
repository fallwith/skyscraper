Welcome to the powerful one-stop scraping-tool to maintain your gamelists!

Skyscraper focuses on RetroPie integration but it can also be used without
RetroPie. However, the RetroPie-Setup has a
[scriptmodule](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/blob/master/scriptmodules/supplementary/skyscraper.sh)
to install this Skyscraper fork.

This fork is based on commit `654a31b` (2022-10-26) from [this
fork](https://github.com/detain/skyscraper). See also [changes](CHANGELOG.md)
made here since Lars' retired his project.
